## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the implementation of a self-designed data structure called BIGINT. It also includes utility functions for complex numbers and fractions. The primary objective of the project is to find the value of ùúã (pi) up to 10000 decimal places using the Chudnovsky algorithm.

## Equations
The project utilizes the Newton-Raphson method for root convergence and the Chudnovsky algorithm to compute the value of pi. Detailed explanations of these algorithms can be found in the documentation.

## Functions & Operations
The repository provides various functions and operations including:

- Basic Operations on Big Integers: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Decimal Division, Remainder (Modulo), GCD, Power, and Factorial.
- Operations on Complex Numbers: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Conjugate.
- Operations on Fractions: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Reduction to Simplest Form.
- Computation of pi: Using the Chudnovsky algorithm.
- Miscellaneous: Set Decimal Precision and Exit the program.

## Output
The repository includes an output image demonstrating the program's functionality and accuracy in calculating pi.

## Tables
The tables in the documentation showcase the benchmarks for calculating the value of pi and the square root of 10005 with varying levels of precision.

## Conclusions
The project successfully implements the BIGINT data structure and performs arithmetic operations on large integers. It also computes the value of pi using the Chudnovsky algorithm up to 10000 decimal places.
